<p>The <b>General Data Protection Regulation</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> ("GDPR") is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)" title="Regulation (European Union)">regulation</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_law" class="mw-redirect" title="EU law">EU law</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_protection" class="mw-redirect" title="Data protection">data protection</a> and privacy for all individuals within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a> (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_business" title="International business">international business</a> by unifying the regulation within the EU.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Superseding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive" title="Data Protection Directive">Data Protection Directive</a> 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements pertaining to the processing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" title="Personal data">personal data</a> of individuals (formally called <i>data subjects</i> in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to an enterprise established in the EEA or—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship—that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.
</p><p>Controllers of personal data must put in place <i>appropriate technical and organisational measures</i> to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization" title="Pseudonymization">pseudonymization</a> or full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization" title="Data anonymization">anonymization</a> where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the data is not available publicly without explicit, informed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent" title="Consent">consent</a>, and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information stored separately. No personal data may be processed unless it is done under a lawful basis specified by the regulation, or unless the data controller or processor has received an unambiguous and individualized affirmation of consent from the data subject. The data subject has the right to revoke this consent at any time.
</p><p>A processor of personal data must clearly disclose any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection" title="Data collection">data collection</a>, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Data subjects have the right to request a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability" title="Data portability">portable</a> copy of the data collected by a processor in a common format, and the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities centre around regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a <i>data protection officer</i> (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach" title="Data breach">data breaches</a> within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.
</p><p>The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016, and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a regulation, not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)" title="Directive (European Union)">directive</a>, it is directly binding and applicable, but does provide flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.

<p>The regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects data from EU residents), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="Cloud computing">cloud service providers</a>), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a "purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity." (Recital 18)
</p><p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, "personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service" title="Social networking service">social networking websites</a>, medical information, or a computer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">IP address</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The precise definitions of terms such as "personal data", "processing", "data subject", "controller" and "processor", are stated in Article 4 of the Regulation.<sup id="cite_ref-eur-lex.europa.eu_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eur-lex.europa.eu-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether Article 48<sup id="cite_ref-eur-lex.europa.eu_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eur-lex.europa.eu-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. Article 48 states that any judgement of a court or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribunal" title="Tribunal">tribunal</a> and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_legal_assistance_treaty" title="Mutual legal assistance treaty">mutual legal assistance treaty</a> in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state. The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> that provides rules on personal data exchanges at national, European, and international levels.
</p><p>A single set of rules will apply to all EU member states. Each member state will establish an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state will co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it will have a single SA as its "lead authority", based on the location of its "main establishment" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority will act as a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-stop_shop" class="mw-redirect" title="One-stop shop">one-stop shop</a>" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> (Articles 46–55 of the GDPR). A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Protection_Board" class="mw-redirect" title="European Data Protection Board">European Data Protection Board</a> (EDPB) will co-ordinate the SAs. EDPB will replace the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_29_Data_Protection_Working_Party" title="Article 29 Data Protection Working Party">Article 29 Data Protection Working Party</a>. There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations (Articles 2(2)(a) and 88 of the GDPR).

<p>Unless a data subject has provided informed consent to data processing for one or more purposes, personal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis to do so. According to Article 6, the lawful purposes are:<sup id="cite_ref-32016R0679_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32016R0679-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li>(a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;</li>
    <li>(b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract;</li>
    <li>(c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;</li>
    <li>(d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;</li>
    <li>(e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;</li>
    <li>(f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a> (especially in the case of children).</li></ul>
<p>If informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing, consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for (Article 7; defined in Article 4). Consent must be a specific, freely-given, plainly-worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be "bundled" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely-given. (Recital 32)
</p><p>Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. (Article 7(3)) A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. (Article 7(4)) Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old (Article 8(1)),<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable (Article 8).<sup id="cite_ref-privacyassociation_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-privacyassociation-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>If consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a data controller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).<sup id="cite_ref-guardian-unneeded_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-guardian-unneeded-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

<p>To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures which meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. Data protection by design and by default (Article 25) require data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization" title="Pseudonymization">pseudonymising</a> personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).
</p><p>When data is collected, data subjects must be clearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy" title="Privacy policy">informed</a> about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithmic</a> basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR,  including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to <a href="#Right_of_access">view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed</a>, their right to obtain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability" title="Data portability">portable copy of the stored data</a>, the right to <a href="#Data_erasure">erasure of data under certain circumstances</a>, the right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithmic</a> basis, and the right to file complaints with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_data_protection_authority" title="National data protection authority">Data Protection Authority</a>. As such, the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer, where applicable.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Data protection impact assessments (Article 35) have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Data_protection_by_design_and_by_default">Data protection by design and by default</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=General_Data_Protection_Regulation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Data protection by design and by default">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Data protection by design and by default (Article 25) requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures should be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers should also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.
</p><p>A report<sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Agency_for_Network_and_Information_Security" title="European Union Agency for Network and Information Security">European Union Agency for Network and Information Security</a> elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pseudonymisation">Pseudonymisation</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=General_Data_Protection_Regulation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Pseudonymisation">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The GDPR refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Pseudonymisation">pseudonymisation</a> as a process that is required when data is stored (as an alternative to the other option of complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Data anonymisation">data anonymisation</a>)<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> to transform personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. An example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software" title="Encryption software">encryption</a>, which renders the original data unintelligible and the process cannot be reversed without access to the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">decryption key</a>. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.
</p><p>Another example of pseudonymisation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)" title="Tokenization (data security)">tokenisation</a>, which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest" title="Data at rest">data at rest</a> that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. The tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. Tokenisation does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type.
</p><p>That requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data. That is achieved by keeping specific data fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden.

<p>Within the GDPR there is a distinct difference between business to consumer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2C" class="mw-redirect" title="B2C">B2C</a>) and business to business (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business" title="Business-to-business">B2B</a>) marketing. Under the GDPR, there are six equally valid grounds to process personal data. There are two of these which are relevant to direct B2B marketing, they are <i>consent</i> or <i>legitimate interest</i>. Recital 47 of the GDPR states that "The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest." <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Using <i>legitimate interest</i> as the basis for B2B marketing involves ensuring key conditions are met:
</p>
<ul><li>"The processing must relate to the legitimate interests of your business or a specified third party, providing that the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject do not override the business' legitimate interest."</li>
    <li>"The processing must be necessary to achieve the legitimate interests of the organisation."<sup id="cite_ref-dma.org.uk_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dma.org.uk-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Additionally, Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR states that the processing is lawful if it is "Necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third-party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual which require protection of personal information, in particular where the individual is a child".<sup id="cite_ref-dma.org.uk_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dma.org.uk-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Therefore, companies can continue to use marketing data for the purposes of B2B engagement as long as the appropriate steps are taken to ensure the data is aligned to a specific objective or campaign. One phrase that is now being used is "Correct Marketing to the Correct Person". As part of this companies will need to keep their marketing databases and CRM up to date in order to carry out valid Legitimate Balance Checks.<sup id="cite_ref-ico.org.uk_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ico.org.uk-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The EU Commission stated that, "Unified data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law" title="Privacy law">privacy laws</a> will create extraordinary opportunities and motivating innovation for businesses not only within Europe but also for the organization who are willing to do business with European states or already running their business in European states." The commission aims for companies to maintain communications and build regulation supporting relationships with each other to ensure best data practices through <i>legitimate balance checks</i><sup id="cite_ref-ico.org.uk_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ico.org.uk-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>
